## Merge Request Process

This is a very new project. Let's try these steps to see if they make sense.

1. Update the README.md so that it is kept up-to-date
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Merge Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
3. You may merge the Merge Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer. If you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
